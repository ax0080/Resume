I am Min-Yan Hsieh. I completed my Bachelor's degree in just three years and am currently pursuing a Doctorate degree in Electrical Engineering at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University. I have a deep passion for learning, excelling, and expanding my knowledge in the fields of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.



During the year of my undergraduate graduation, I engaged in a summer internship at Richtek Technology. This experience not only allowed me to acquire expertise in analog circuits but also helped me refine my teamwork and communication skills. It laid a solid foundation for my future leadership in projects.



In addition to my academic achievements, I gained invaluable industry experience through my participation in Novatek Microelectronics Corp's industry-academia collaboration program. Within this program, I took the lead in a project and applied my technical knowledge in RF and mixed-signal design. Additionally, I served as a teaching assistant for PLL courses.



Beyond my specialization in RF and analog circuits, I am well-versed in Digital IC design, encompassing Cell-based IC Design flow, verification, and APR. Moreover, I possess proficiency in VLSI, computer architecture, and compiler design.



I also took part in a project initiated by MediaTek, which exposed me to mixed-signal circuitry, including Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and SerDes, and provided insights into industry perspectives on addressing challenges.



To expand my knowledge across diverse fields, I embarked on an internship at the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), where I focused on computer vision development. This experience deepened my understanding of software development, as well as AI and machine learning.



Currently, in parallel with my Ph.D. studies, I am employed at Taiwan Electronic System Design Automation (TESDA). In this role, I am actively involved in SoC verification and the development of GPU, NPU, and DLA.



Furthermore, my experience extends to DFT and JTAG design, as well as the design and verification of UART, SPI, I2C, and AMBA protocols. I also have expertise in high-speed protocols such as PCIe, MIPI, UCIe, DDR5, and USB4.0, among others.

I have also joined the Google Developer Student Club to work on an AI Automatic Scheduling System, which has further enhanced my practical experience in software development.



Overall, my diverse academic and industry experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded and accomplished individual in the fields of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am eager to continue contributing to innovative research and technological advancements in this dynamic field.
